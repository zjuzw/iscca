% This is a demo . 
%
% In this illustration,a 4-channel recording was simulated for 3 subjects. Each recording 
% is a mixture of an early response,a late response, and white noise. 
%
% The late response has the same waveform across subjects and is captured by the first ISCCA
% component. The waveform of the early response slightly varies across subjects and is captured 
% by the second ISCCA component. The noise signal is captured by the 3rd and the 4th ISCCA 
% components. The early response is simulated by a sawtooth signal. Its phase is identical within
% each subject across channels but varies across subjects. Both the early and the late responses 
% have random polarity and amplitude in each channel.

% In this illustration, since the data have only 4 channels, the DSS dimension reduction step is
% omitted and the mCCA is applied to the 4-channel data directly.
