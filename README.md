To optimally extract neurophsyiological processes that are common across subjects, we propose an analysis method called the Inter-Subject 
Coherent Component Analysis (ISCCA). The ISCCA decomposes the multi-channel MEG recordings of each subject into components and maximizes 
the inter-subject correlation of each component. Each ISCCA component is extracted by a spatial filter and can be viewed as the recording 
from a virtual sensor spatially tuned to a cortical network that shows coherent neural activity over subjects. The ISCCA spatial filters 
are subject-specific and normalize individual differences in response topography. Since the ISCCA components are maximally correlated over
subjects, they can be directly averaged for group level analysis.
